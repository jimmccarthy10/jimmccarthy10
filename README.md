Hello world!
I'm new to Github and my intention is to bring exciting contract and full-time opportunities to the technical world.
I'll be kind and try to match best to your suitability and will always suggest if not available to share with friends and associates.
We all know someone out of work at any given time.
Thank you for welcoming me and let's see if we cannot find your next assignment or career opportunity.
Jim (732) 372-1034
